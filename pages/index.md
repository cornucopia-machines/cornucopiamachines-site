## Our Vision

To create a platform for sustainable family and community food production, introducing a new consumer product category. The Instant Pot of food resilience – but with a loyal subscriber base and a strong product pipeline for lasting revenue.

## The Problem

Growing nutrient-dense food is labor-intensive, climate-sensitive, and knowledge-dependent — especially when managing multiple crops in raised beds. Most solutions are either too simple, too DIY, or too complex.

## Our Solution

The Cornucopia GrowMachine turns raised beds into smart, semi-autonomous food production units. It automates irrigation, fertigation, pest alerts, and crop scheduling using hyperlocal sensor data and a proprietary crop-intelligence engine.

Our freemium software model serves hobby growers with a single bed and pro users managing multiple crop-dedicated beds.

## Key Features

* Sensor-Based Irrigation – Adjusts to crop needs, mulch, and soil data — not timers.
* Environmental Alerts – Warns of conditions linked to crop stress or disease.
* Built-In Crop Intelligence – 50+ vegetables with root depth, fertility, and harvest logic.
* Automates Task & Fertigation Scheduling from bed map, weather data, and live sensors.
* Plug-and-Play Hardware – Solar-powered, connected, purpose-built for food growing.
* Scalable Architecture – From single beds to orchards, livestock, and season extension.
* Beginner Support – Ready to use bed plans and guided growing content

## Market Opportunity

* 100M+ home gardens in EU \+ US
* 5M+ raised beds sold annually
* Climate volatility and the home food movement create a perfect market inflection point

## Early Traction

* 2 pilot systems deployed in Hungary since 2021
* Lower decision fatigue, improved crop quality, up to 60% water savings
* Modular tech stack ready for expansion

## Who We’re Looking For

* **Co-founders** with hardware production, growth, or ops experience
* **Pre-seed investors** to support hardware manufacturing, software rollout, and pilot
* **Pilot partners** (urban farms, schools, homesteaders) for Q1 2026 deployment
