## The problem

Growing nutrient-dense organic food to supply a family or a community is labor-intensive, climate-sensitive and knowledge-dependent, especially if you want to grow several types of crops at once.

## Our Vision

To build a **platform for regenerative food production** — one raised bed, tree, or animal zone at a time. Our devices represent a new consumer product category, like the Airfryer or the Instant Pot – but with a subscriber base.

## Our solution

The Cornucopia GrowMachine makes families successful at growing their own food from raised bed to table by automating irrigation, fertigation, pest protection and task scheduling based on hyperlocal sensor information and a proprietary crop intelligence system, turning raised beds into smart, semi-autonomous production units. The hardware comes with a freemium software model where the subscription layer targets two different niches: hobby growers that grow many different crops in one raised bed, and pro users who plant one type of crop per bed.

## Key features

* **Sensor-Based Irrigation**
  Adapts watering based on crop-specific intelligence and hyperlocal soil measurements — not fixed timers

* **Built-in Crop-Intelligence**
  50+ vegetables with root depth, fertility, phenology, plant health and harvest timing logic

* **Sensor-Based Environmental Alerts**
  Environmental measurements suggest plant health risks such as humidity reaching levels specific to fungal diseases

* **Task & Fertigation Scheduler**
  Generates sowing, transplant, harvest, and feeding plans automatically from a bed map, OpenMeteo history and hyperlocal measurements

* **Plug-and-Play Hardware**
  Solar-powered, connected control modules built with growing food in mind

* **Scalable Infrastructure**
  Pro subscriptions support multi-bed allotments or remote farms, livestock integrations

## Market Opportunity

* 100M+ home gardens in EU \+ US
* 5M+ raised beds sold yearly, a growing market
* Water restrictions and food insecurity accelerate demand for resilient, local food systems
* Current competitors are either **too simplistic** (lawn smart garden kits) or **too tinkerer-oriented** (IoT platforms like Sonoff, Tuya etc.), or **too complex** (industrial agrotech platforms)

## Early Traction

* 2 pilot systems deployed in Hungary since 2021
* Up to **60% water savings**, improved crop quality, lower decision fatigue
* Modular tech stack ready for expansion into orchard, poultry, and greenhouse automation

## Who We’re Looking For

* **Experts** with prior experience in hardware-based products, early growth, and ops
* **Pre-seed investors** to support hardware manufacturing, software rollout, and partner pilots
* **Pilot partners** (urban farms, schools, homesteaders) for Q1 2026 deployment
